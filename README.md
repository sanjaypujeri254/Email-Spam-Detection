# Email-Spam-Detection
I will be building an email spam detector using Python. Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to emails sent to a large number of users simultaneously, often containing deceptive messages, fraudulent schemes, or potentially harmful phishing content. I will utilize machine learning techniques to train my spam detector to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam. By developing this detector, I aim to enhance email security and protect users from falling victim to spam emails.
